Hi, I'm Wu Xingsu from University of Shanghai for Science and Technology.

00:07.000 --> 00:17.000
I would like to introduce our work titled Source 3 Domentitation with Frozen Body Model, Foundation Model.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
First, I would like to introduce Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, UDA.

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
UDA until brings the gap between the source and target domain, which may have different data distribution,

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
both labeled source data and unlabeled target data available during the adaptation.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
But it's unrealistic for some real-world scenarios involving privacy,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
because the source domain data cannot be assessed.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Thus, more recent method focusing on Source 3 Domain Adaptation.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Therefore, the goal of the setting is transferring per change.
