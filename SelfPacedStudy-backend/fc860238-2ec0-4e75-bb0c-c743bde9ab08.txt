Hi, I'm Wu Xingsu from University of Shanghai for Science and Technology.
I would like to introduce our work titled Source 3 Domentitation with Frozen Body Model, Foundation Model.
First, I would like to introduce Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, UDA.
UDA until brings the gap between the source and target domain, which may have different data distribution,
both labeled source data and unlabeled target data available during the adaptation.
But it's unrealistic for some real-world scenarios involving privacy,
because the source domain data cannot be assessed.
Thus, more recent method focusing on Source 3 Domain Adaptation.
Therefore, the goal of the setting is transferring per change.
