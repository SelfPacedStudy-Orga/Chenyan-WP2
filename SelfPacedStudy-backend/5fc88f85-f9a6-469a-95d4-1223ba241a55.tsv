0	7000	Hi, I'm Wu Xingsu from University of Shanghai for Science and Technology.
7000	17000	I would like to introduce our work titled Source 3 Domentitation with Frozen Body Model, Foundation Model.
17000	23000	First, I would like to introduce Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, UDA.
23000	31000	UDA until brings the gap between the source and target domain, which may have different data distribution,
31000	38000	both labeled source data and unlabeled target data available during the adaptation.
38000	44000	But it's unrealistic for some real-world scenarios involving privacy,
44000	48000	because the source domain data cannot be assessed.
48000	54000	Thus, more recent method focusing on Source 3 Domain Adaptation.
54000	59000	Therefore, the goal of the setting is transferring per change.
