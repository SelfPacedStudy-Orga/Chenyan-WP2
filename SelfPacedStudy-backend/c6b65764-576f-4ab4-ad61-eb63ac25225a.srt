Hi, I'm Wu Xingsu from University of Shanghai for Science and Technology.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I would like to introduce our work titled Source 3 Domentitation with Frozen Body Model, Foundation Model.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
First, I would like to introduce Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, UDA.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
UDA until brings the gap between the source and target domain, which may have different data distribution,

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
both labeled source data and unlabeled target data available during the adaptation.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But it's unrealistic for some real-world scenarios involving privacy,

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
because the source domain data cannot be assessed.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thus, more recent method focusing on Source 3 Domain Adaptation.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Therefore, the goal of the setting is transferring per change.
